This is an aim trainer initially developed for mobile, I made it working on PC as well.
You have 50 targets to hit, you get more points if you hit them quickly.

The more intesresting part is that you can modify different parameters of the crosshair ( thickness - length- center gap - opacity - color ) and the target (spawn area range - color), and these parameters are permanently saved !
